# StellarFramework.Extensions

Source assets for the Algorithms, World, and Flow capabilities in StellarFramework. This repository contains Unity <code>Assets</code> content; it is not a standalone Unity project or a UPM package. The HybridCLR code hot-update Kit and HotUpdate Publisher are part of the matching General release.

Release: 1.0.1

Source commit: [a6c6a25ffb658740ec01659e109af19439fb4fb1](https://github.com/StarrDream/StellarFramework.Dev/commit/a6c6a25ffb658740ec01659e109af19439fb4fb1)

Install the matching [StellarFramework General](https://github.com/StarrDream/StellarFramework) release first. The General profiles and UPM packages required by this release are listed as <code>requiredGeneralProfileIds</code> and <code>requiredUpm</code> in <code>RELEASE-MANIFEST.json</code>.

## Recommended: export selected Kits from General

1. Clone and open the matching General project.
2. Merge this repository's <code>Assets</code> content into the General project's <code>Assets</code> directory. Preserve all <code>.meta</code> files.
3. Merge the package specifications in <code>requiredUpm</code> into <code>Packages/manifest.json</code>; use the versions in the manifest.
4. Wait for Unity to resolve dependencies and compile.
5. Open **StellarFramework → Export**, select the extension profiles you need, and export them.

This workflow is suited to teams that want to add only selected extension Kits to a game project. The General catalog resolves framework profile dependencies.

## Add source to an existing Unity project

Confirm that the project contains the profiles listed in <code>requiredGeneralProfileIds</code>. Merge this repository's <code>Assets</code> content, add the packages listed in <code>requiredUpm</code>, preserve <code>.meta</code> files, and wait for Unity to compile. Configure and verify each Kit using its guide.
