# StellarFramework.Extensions

Extension Kits for use with StellarFramework General. This repository provides Algorithms, World, and Flow capabilities. It is not a standalone Unity project; start with the matching General release.

Release: **1.0.3**

Dev source commit: [4eaff35790c217c9d65994b9d95788865aa458e5](https://github.com/StarrDream/StellarFramework.Dev/commit/4eaff35790c217c9d65994b9d95788865aa458e5)

## Framework overview

Extensions adds algorithms, world organization and generation, placement rules, and workflow orchestration. It is distributed as Unity Assets source. Merge it into the General project at the same release version, then use Tools Hub to export the Kits your project needs.

1. Download the matching [StellarFramework General release](https://github.com/StarrDream/StellarFramework/releases) and open it with Unity 2022.3.62f3c1.
2. Merge this repository's `Assets` directory into General's `Assets` directory. Preserve all `.meta` files.
3. In **StellarFramework → Export**, select the extension Kits or Profile and review its dependencies.
4. Import the unitypackage into your Unity project and install the listed dependencies.

## Requirements

- Unity Editor 2022.3.62f3c1
- StellarFramework General at the same release version
- Unity Package Manager access when opening the General project
- Preserve Unity `.meta` files when merging source

Extensions is a source repository, not a UPM package. Profiles and prerequisites are listed in `RELEASE-MANIFEST.json` and the General Kit Catalog.

## Framework concepts

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| General | Supplies the `StellarFramework.cs` architecture foundation and shared Kits |
| Extensions Kit | Optional capabilities in Algorithms, World, and Flow; import only what the project needs |
| Catalog Profile | Declares export files, required General Profiles, and external UPM dependencies |
| Tools Hub | Configure and export in the General project after merging Extensions source; not part of the game Player |

Preserve `.meta` files to retain Unity asset GUIDs and scene or prefab references.

## Architecture

The MSV architecture comes from `StellarFramework.cs` in the matching General release. Extensions adds optional algorithms and systems; it does not replace the architecture container or require every extension Kit.
